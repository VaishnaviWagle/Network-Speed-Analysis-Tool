# Network-Speed-Analysis-Tool
Individual Project - Technologies : Python,Tkinter,Speedtest Python Library
Network Speed Analysis Tool is a GUI-based Python application that checks and displays your current internet Download Speed, Upload Speed, and Ping in real time â€” along with animated progress bars for a more interactive experience.

This project helped me explore real-world problem-solving using Python, while strengthening my skills in:
GUI design with Tkinter
Using third-party libraries like Speedtest
Threading and time-based UI updates for smooth animation
